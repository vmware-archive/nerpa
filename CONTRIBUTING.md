# How to Contribute
We welcome external contributions. Both DDlog and P4 are fast-moving technologies, available on increasing numbers of platforms. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that make things work for you. Contributor guidelines help us stay on top of things. These contributing guidelines were heavily modeled after Puppet's [[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Submit a GitHub issue if a relevant one does not already exist.
    * Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce any bugs.
    * Please provide version and operating system information for major components (DDlog, P4, etc.)
    * A ticket is not needed for trivial changes
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes
* Create a topic branch, from where you want to base your work. This is typically `main`. Avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace before committing: `git diff --check`
* Make sure you have added necessary tests for your changes
* See the `README` for details on running tests
